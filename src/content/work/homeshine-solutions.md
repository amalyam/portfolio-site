I built www.homeshinesolutions.com with: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [MUI](https://mui.com/), deployed it with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and made use of [Google Cloud API](https://cloud.google.com/apis), [SparkPost API](https://www.sparkpost.com/), and [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com) image carousel. Throughout the process, I collaborated with the founder of HomeShine Solutions, LLC. to ensure that the site met his vision and to help him understand various technical decisions. In building this website, I also provided graphic design and copywriting services for the logo and text.

<div class="ml-5">
  <li>Google Cloud API was used for storing the contact form submission data in a Google Sheet so the owner could easily view all inquiries in one place</li>
  <li>SparkPost API was used to send a copy of the contact form responses to the user and to the owner of the company so each would be notified</li>
</div>
